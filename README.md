# YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing Project

## Overview
This project aims to create a sophisticated data collection and storage system for YouTube content. By utilizing Python scripting, MongoDB, SQL databases, and Streamlit, the project focuses on efficiently gathering YouTube data, structuring it, and presenting meaningful insights through an interactive web interface.

## Features
- Data collection from YouTube using Python scripts and API integration.
- Storage of collected data in both MongoDB and SQL databases.
- Streamlit-based interactive dashboard for data visualization and exploration.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- MongoDB
- SQL databases
- Streamlit
- YouTube API

## Project Structure
- `data_collection`: Contains Python scripts for data gathering from the YouTube API.
- `database`: Includes scripts for setting up and managing MongoDB and SQL databases.
- `web_app`: Houses the Streamlit application for data visualization.
- `examples`: Illustrative examples of collected and processed data.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up MongoDB and SQL databases using the provided scripts in the `database` folder.
3. Run the data collection scripts in the `data_collection` folder to gather YouTube data.
4. Navigate to the `web_app` folder and launch the Streamlit application to visualize insights.

## Usage
- Modify data collection scripts to customize the information you want to gather.
- Extend the Streamlit dashboard by adding new visualizations and features.
- Experiment with different querying techniques for both MongoDB and SQL databases.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for enhancements or bug fixes.
